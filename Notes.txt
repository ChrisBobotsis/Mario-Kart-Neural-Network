For some reason, when you move the window after running display_screen.py it does not update the position of the window...
It seems like it always want it to be in a certain location. I'm not sure why.

There still seems to be an issue when first starting the win32gui_screen.py as it also add parts of windows around the emulator window...
It seems to fix itself if I restart or alter the window shape though
